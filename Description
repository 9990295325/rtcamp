1. Check if docker and docker-compose is installed on the system. If not present, install the missing packages.

>>  "Here we are writting a script to check whether Docker and Docker-compose is running in the system or not ,if no the script will install both instantly,these steps are done at the beggining of the script as       we would be using docker-compose to create multiple containers where we will be hosting out wordpress website.
&&


2. The script should be able to create a WordPress site using the latest WordPress Version. Please provide a way for the user to provide the site name as a command-line argument.It must be a LEMP stack running inside containers (Docker) and a docker-compose file is a must.

>> Now we have docker running in our system them we will write docker-compose.yml file for building multiple containers for LEMP which is :-
>> LINUX
>> Engine x ( NGINX) ,
>> Mysql
>> PhP : runnning on localhost:8080 port
>> Wordpress : running at localhost:8000 port

3. Create a /etc/hosts entry for example.com pointing to localhost. Here we are assuming the user has provided example.com as the site      name.
   >>All of these commands should be running in roo user which is (SUDO).
   >> now we will make changes in /etc/host
   >> where we will add local host with site_name.

4. Prompt the user to open example.com in a browser if all goes well and the site is up and healthy.
   Add another subcommand to enable/disable the site (stopping/starting the containers)
   Add one more subcommand to delete the site (deleting containers and local files).

   >> ./script.sh SITE_NAME enable // start restart the containers.
   >> ./script.sh SITE_NAME disable // stop the containers.
   >> ./script.sh SITE_NAME delete //delete the containers.
